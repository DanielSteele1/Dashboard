# Spotify Stats - Get data of your personal listening history, displayed with charts and graphs, and visualised with a clean and modern UI. 


I've implemented drag-and-drop functionality using React DnD, enabling smooth task reordering within columns.
To keep the project lightweight and focused on frontend fundamentals, I used localStorage for data persistence, ensuring a responsive and self-contained user experience while maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code.

### Alternatively, you can switch the layout to a masonry layout, which enables users to visually see more at once.
